# Project Name

## Description

# Storage Manager
This C program is a storage manager that provides an abstraction of reading and writing to disk pages. It provides a layer of abstraction between the file system and the higher-level components of a database management system.

# Buffer Manager
This file, buffer_mgr.c, is part of a larger project. It's responsible for managing the buffer in memory, which is a temporary storage area where data is kept before it's written to disk or after it's read from disk.

Key functionalities include:

Buffer Initialization: Setting up the buffer pool with a specified size.
Page Management: Handling the reading, writing, and replacement of pages in the buffer.
Buffer Shutdown: Cleaning up and freeing the buffer pool when it's no longer needed.
This file is likely to interact with other components of the system, such as disk management and query processing modules.

To understand this file, you should have a good understanding of buffer management concepts, such as buffer pool, page replacement algorithms, and disk I/O operations.

Please refer to the comments in the code for more specific details about the implementation.

# Record Manager
The record_mgr.c file is part of a database management system (DBMS). This file specifically handles the management of records within the database.

Features
Record Creation: This module is responsible for creating new records in the database.

Record Deletion: It also handles the deletion of existing records from the database.

Record Modification: Any changes to the records are managed by this module.

Record Retrieval: It retrieves records based on certain conditions or queries.

Please note that the exact functionality may vary depending on the specific implementation in the record_mgr.c file. Always refer to the source code and associated documentation for accurate information.

# B+ Tree
Key Features
Value Comparison: The valueEquals and valueSmaller functions compare two values of the same data type and return a boolean result.

Boolean Operations: The boolNot, boolAnd, and boolOr functions perform boolean operations on the input values.

Expression Evaluation: The evalExpr function evaluates an expression based on its type. It supports operator expressions, constant expressions, and attribute reference expressions.

Expression Cleanup: The freeExpr function frees the memory allocated for an expression.

Value Cleanup: The freeVal function frees the memory allocated for a value.

Usage
This file is a low-level component that can be used to build higher-level database management system components such as a Query Processor. It is used to evaluate expressions that are part of a database query.
